1.

On this slide you see the formula:

10 Pb / 128 Mb * 3 * 150 = 35 156 250 000 b ~= 35.1 Gb

which is NOT correct. It should be:

10 Pb / (128 Mb * 3 ) * 150 B = 3 906 250 000 b ~= 3.9 Gb

because the level of granularity on the Namenode is block, not replica. Please mention, that during the assignments the second formula supposed to be used (this video will be updated as soon as possible).


10 PB capacity
150B avg block size on namenode
128MB block size

1 PB / (64 MB * 3 ) * 300 B

2.
v = 60 mb/s
seek_t= 5 ms = 0.005 s

read_t/seek_t=200
read_t= 200 * seek_t

v = block_size/read_t
block_size = v * read_t
block_size =  60 mb/s * 200 *0.005 s
block_size = 60 mb
